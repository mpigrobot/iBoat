# About
The code for iBoat-An Anduino-drived boat controlled with iPhone or iPad via WiFi.
It is the graduate design project for undergraduate student Mao Siyi, who has pursued the dream of making an intelligent boat for two years. The project is supervised by 
[Samuel](http://cie.shmtu.edu.cn/archives/3953) with Machine Perception and Interaction Group (MPIG).

# Hardware
The boat is modified based on a toy model, but all the original inner components except motors are replaced. A open source Arduino Pro Micro board is employed as the new controller, and Wifi module is involved to make it possible for remote control with smart phone.   

# Software
The code of slave follows the standard Arduino routine, the code of master is programmed in Objective-C, the general way for IOS app development.

# Video
A online video addressing the performance of iBoat is available at: [http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTI2MzQzNDQ0MA==.html](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTI2MzQzNDQ0MA==.html)

# Acknowledge
Thanks to Apple support team (China) for authorizing us the free Apple developer ID to saving us 99 dollar, but the application takes so long time, it is really tough :(
